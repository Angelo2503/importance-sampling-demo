# Importance-Sampling-Demo
A comprehensive Jupyter notebook illustrating the Importance Sampling method: theoretical setup, implementation in Python, numerical results, and visualization of densities, weighted samples, and importance weights.

**A practical demonstration of the Importance Sampling method in Python**

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook (`importance_sampling.ipynb`) that walks through a complete example of importance sampling:
- Target distribution: N(0, 1)  
- Proposal distribution: N(0, 3²)  
- Computation of importance weights  
- Monte Carlo estimate of E[θ²] under the target  
- Visualizations of densities, weighted samples, and weight distributions (via Plotly)

## How to use

1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Open `importance_sampling.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.  
3. Run all cells to reproduce the results and visualizations.  
4. Explore and modify the code to experiment with different proposals or target distributions.
